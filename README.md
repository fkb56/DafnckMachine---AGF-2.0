## üåü Overview: What is Agentic Coding Framework, powered by Pheromind?

Welcome to the **Agentic Coding Framework, powered by Pheromind** ‚Äì a revolutionary system designed to orchestrate fully autonomous, specification-driven software development. Pheromind acts as the **intelligent swarm system and execution engine** for the project lifecycle, which is itself defined by the sequence of scripts within the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) directory. This project isn't just about generating code; it's about establishing a robust, repeatable, and high-quality process that takes your initial idea (often guided by an `01_AI-RUN/` script like [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:1)) and transforms it into a functional product with AI-verifiable outcomes.

Pheromind leverages a structured, phase-by-phase approach, where specialized AI agents (defined in [`.roomodes`](.roomodes:1)) execute the instructions laid out in the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts. A central `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` interprets natural language summaries from these executions to manage project state in the [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) file, while the `üßê @uber-orchestrator` delegates tasks based on this evolving state and the Master Project Plan (itself an output of an early `01_AI-RUN/` phase).

The result? Unprecedented consistency, adherence to detailed AI-verifiable specifications, and the automation of complex development workflows defined in [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/), freeing human developers to focus on innovation and high-level strategy. For an ultra-detailed explanation of the Pheromind system, its agents, and core concepts, please refer to the **updated [`ModeREADME.md`](./ModeREADME.md:1)**. For a detailed technical breakdown of Pheromind executing the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) workflow, refer to the **updated [`logic.md`](./logic.md:1)**.

## ü§î Why Use Agentic Coding Framework with Pheromind?

This framework, with Pheromind as its execution engine for the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) workflow, is built to solve key challenges in modern software development, especially when leveraging AI:

*   **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Ensures every task and phase, as defined in the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts and executed by Pheromind, has a concrete, measurable, and AI-confirmable result.
*   **Autonomous Full-Cycle Automation:** Pheromind autonomously executes the entire project lifecycle defined by the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts, from initial setup to deployment, guided by the [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) state.
*   **Swarm Intelligence & Adaptability:** Specialized AI agents collaborate indirectly through the [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) file, allowing for dynamic task allocation as they execute the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow.
*   **Structured & Interpreted Communication:** The `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` translates rich natural language summaries from Task Orchestrators (reporting on `01_AI-RUN/` phase execution) into structured `:signals`, enabling nuanced state updates.
*   **Human-Centric Documentation Trail:** Maintains a `documentationRegistry` within [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1), tracking all key human-readable project artifacts generated during the Pheromind-driven execution of the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow.
*   **Scalable & Robust Planning:** The Master Project Plan, an output of an early `01_AI-RUN/` phase, allows complex projects defined by these scripts to be methodically managed by the AI swarm.
*   **Clear Human Oversight:** While highly autonomous, Pheromind provides clear visibility into the execution of the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow through the `documentationRegistry` and AI-verifiable checkpoints.

## ‚ú® Core Features of Pheromind Executing the `01_AI-RUN/` Workflow

*   üß† **Pheromone-Based Swarm Intelligence:** Decentralized coordination via a shared state file ([`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1)) managed by the `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`, reflecting the progress of the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow.
*   üéØ **AI-Verifiable Project Execution:** All tasks within the `01_AI-RUN/` scripts are defined with AI-confirmable end results, ensuring tangible progress.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Autonomous Task Orchestration:** The `üßê @uber-orchestrator` delegates work to Task-Specific Orchestrators based on the Master Project Plan and current [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) state, following the sequence defined in an entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script.
*   üí¨ **Natural Language Summary Interpretation:** The `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` uses `interpretationLogic` from [`.swarmConfig`](.swarmConfig:1) to convert narrative progress reports (on `01_AI-RUN/` phase execution) into structured `:signals` and documentation updates.
*   üìñ **Comprehensive Documentation Registry:** Tracks all human-readable project documents (specs, plans, code, reports generated during the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow) within [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1).
*   üîÑ **Cyclical "Boomerang Task" Lifecycle:** A continuous flow of delegation (based on `01_AI-RUN/` scripts), execution, verification, reporting, and state update.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Configurable Agent Behaviors & Logic:** Agent roles defined in [`.roomodes`](.roomodes:1); Scribe's interpretation logic defined in [`.swarmConfig`](.swarmConfig:1), both crucial for executing the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow.
*   üîó **MCP Integration:** Built to utilize Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for extended AI capabilities during `01_AI-RUN/` execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Pheromind Agentic Flow Executing `01_AI-RUN/` Scripts

The Agentic Coding Framework is powered by Pheromind, which acts as the **execution engine and state management layer** for the workflow defined by the sequence of scripts in the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) directory.
The overall 'Agentic Flow' or project lifecycle is thus defined by the specific sequence and content of these [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts. These scripts typically cover phases such as:
*   **Initialization & Setup:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md`](01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md:1))
*   **Idea Capture & Refinement:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/03_Idea.md`](01_AI-RUN/03_Idea.md:1))
*   **Market Research:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/04_Market_Research.md`](01_AI-RUN/04_Market_Research.md:1))
*   **Core Concept Definition:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/05_Core_Concept.md`](01_AI-RUN/05_Core_Concept.md:1))
*   **PRD Generation:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md`](01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md:1))
*   **Technical Specifications & Documentation Setup:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:1))
*   **Task Management & Breakdown:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/09_Task_Manager.md`](01_AI-RUN/09_Task_Manager.md:1))
*   **Implementation Cycles:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md`](01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md:1))
*   **Testing & QA:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/10_Testing.md`](01_AI-RUN/10_Testing.md:1))
*   **Deployment:** (e.g., driven by [`01_AI-RUN/11_Deployment.md`](01_AI-RUN/11_Deployment.md:1))

Pheromind executes these phases by following the logic within each script. The detailed mechanism is as follows:

1.  **Initiation:** The user activates the `üé© @head-orchestrator` with parameters including the `Original_User_Directive_Payload_Path_Field` pointing to an entry-point script from the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) directory (e.g., [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:1)). This script defines the overall project flow or a major phase.
2.  **Uber-Orchestration:** The `üßê @uber-orchestrator` receives this entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script. It uses this script as its primary guide to understand the project's phases and sequence. It then delegates major project phases (as outlined in the `01_AI-RUN/` script) to appropriate **Task-Specific Orchestrators**.
3.  **Task-Specific Orchestration & Worker Execution:** Task-Specific Orchestrators receive their directives and consult their own specific `01_AI-RUN/*.md` files (e.g., [`01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md`](01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md:1) for PRD generation). These scripts provide detailed instructions for the phase. The Orchestrator then breaks down these instructions into granular tasks for **Worker Agents** (e.g., coders, testers, spec writers). Each task is designed with an **AI-verifiable end result**.
4.  **State Management & Reporting:** As Worker Agents complete tasks based on the `01_AI-RUN/` instructions, they report AI-verifiable outcomes. Task Orchestrators aggregate these and send comprehensive natural language summaries to the `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`. The Scribe, using `interpretationLogic` from [`.swarmConfig`](.swarmConfig:1), updates the [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) file with `:signals` reflecting the `01_AI-RUN/` phase's progress and updates the `documentationRegistry`. Agent roles and behaviors are defined in [`.roomodes`](.roomodes:1).
5.  **Cycle Continuation:** The `üé© @head-orchestrator` re-engages the `üßê @uber-orchestrator`, which consults the updated [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) and the entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script to determine the next phase of the workflow to execute.

This cyclical process continues, with Pheromind agents autonomously executing the workflow defined in the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts, always focusing on AI-verifiable outcomes.

## üöÄ Getting Started with Pheromind for `01_AI-RUN/` Workflow Execution

Initiating a Pheromind project to execute the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) workflow involves a specific setup:

1.  **Fork this Repository:** This creates your project's dedicated workspace.
2.  **Environment Configuration:**
    *   Ensure your AI agent environment (e.g., Cursor, Cline, Windsurf with a compatible LLM like Claude 3.x) is operational.
    *   Configure API keys for any MCP servers or external services your agents will use.
3.  **Define Agent Behaviors: The [`.roomodes`](./.roomodes:1) File:**
    *   This JSON file (typically at `your_project_root/.roomodes`) contains the definitions for all Pheromind agents. Review and customize as needed.
4.  **CRITICAL - Establish the Scribe's Rulebook: The [`.swarmConfig`](./.swarmConfig:1) File:**
    *   This JSON file **must be created by you** in your project root (e.g., `your_project_root/.swarmConfig`).
    *   It contains the **`interpretationLogic`** that the `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` uses to translate natural language summaries (from `01_AI-RUN/` phase executions) into structured `:signals` and `documentationRegistry` updates in [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1).
    *   Refer to [`ModeREADME.md`](./ModeREADME.md:1) for details on its structure.
5.  **Select Your Entry-Point `01_AI-RUN/` Script:**
    *   The [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) directory contains scripts defining various project phases and workflows (e.g., [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:1) for a full project lifecycle, or [`01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md`](01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md:1) for a specific phase). Choose the script that represents the starting point of the workflow you want Pheromind to execute.
6.  **Initiate the Pheromind Swarm:**
    *   Activate the `üé© @head-orchestrator` agent.
    *   You **must** provide it with the following parameters (example values):
        *   `Original_User_Directive_Type_Field`: `"PheromindWorkflow"` (or similar, indicating an `01_AI-RUN/` script execution)
        *   `Original_User_Directive_Payload_Path_Field`: `"01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md"` (path to your chosen entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script)
        *   `Original_Project_Root_Path_Field`: `"/path/to/your/project_root"` (absolute path)
        *   `Pheromone_File_Path`: `".pheromone"` (path to the pheromone file, typically in project root)
    *   The `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` will bootstrap the [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) file if it doesn't exist.

Pheromind will then use the specified `01_AI-RUN/` script as the blueprint for its execution, with agents carrying out the instructions defined within that script and subsequent scripts it references.

For a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to Pheromind setup and initiation, please see the "Getting Started with Pheromind: An Ultra-Detailed Guide" section in **updated [`ModeREADME.md`](./ModeREADME.md:1)**.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap: Pheromind Project Lifecycle - Executing the `01_AI-RUN/` Workflow

The Pheromind workflow is designed for comprehensive, autonomous AI-driven project execution. Pheromind acts as the **execution engine**, carrying out the instructions defined in the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts, guided by a Master Project Plan (itself an output of an early `01_AI-RUN/` phase) and the evolving state within the [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) file. Human oversight is facilitated through the `documentationRegistry` and AI-verifiable checkpoints. Here‚Äôs a conceptual journey:

**Phase 0: Foundational Setup & Initiation (Pheromind executing [`01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md`](01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md:1) & [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:1) logic)**
1.  **User:** Configures the environment, defines agent behaviors in [`.roomodes`](./.roomodes:1), and critically, creates the [`.swarmConfig`](.swarmConfig:1) file with `interpretationLogic`.
2.  **User:** Selects an entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script (e.g., [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:1)) that defines the initial project scope or overall workflow.
3.  **User:** Activates the `üé© @head-orchestrator` with the path to this entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script, project root, and [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) file.
4.  **Pheromind System:**
    *   `üé© @head-orchestrator` passes the directive (the `01_AI-RUN/` script path) to `üßê @uber-orchestrator`.
    *   `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` bootstraps [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) (if new project).
    *   Pheromind begins executing the logic defined in the initial `01_AI-RUN/` scripts (e.g., tasks from [`01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md`](01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md:1) like creating foundational documents, potentially including a Master Project Plan).

**Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Pheromind executing `01_AI-RUN/` script for Master Plan)**
1.  **`üßê @uber-orchestrator`:** Following the entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script, delegates to a Task Orchestrator (e.g., `üåü @orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan`) to execute the `01_AI-RUN/` script responsible for creating a **Master Project Plan**.
    *   **Mandate:** The `01_AI-RUN/` script for this phase ensures the Master Project Plan details subsequent phases and micro-tasks, each with a specific **AI-verifiable end result**.
2.  **Task Orchestrator & Workers:** Execute the relevant `01_AI-RUN/` script to produce the Master Project Plan (e.g., `docs/Master_Project_Plan.md`).
3.  **Reporting & State Update:** The orchestrator reports the AI-verifiable creation of the Master Project Plan to the `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`.
4.  **`‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`:** Updates [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) with `:signals` (e.g., `master_plan_created_verified`) and adds the Master Project Plan to the `documentationRegistry`.

**Phase 2: Iterative Development & Execution (Pheromind executing subsequent `01_AI-RUN/*.md` phases)**
1.  **`üßê @uber-orchestrator`:** Guided by the Master Project Plan, current `:signals` in [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1), and the overall sequence from the entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script, delegates the next phase (e.g., "Idea Generation" by executing [`01_AI-RUN/03_Idea.md`](01_AI-RUN/03_Idea.md:1) logic, "Market Research" via [`01_AI-RUN/04_Market_Research.md`](01_AI-RUN/04_Market_Research.md:1), or "PRD Generation" using [`01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md`](01_AI-RUN/06_PRD_Generation.md:1)) to a relevant **Task-Specific Orchestrator**.
2.  **Task-Specific Orchestrator:** Consults the Master Project Plan and its assigned `01_AI-RUN/*.md` script. This script details the tasks for its phase. The orchestrator manages **Worker Agents** to execute these tasks.
3.  **Worker Agents:** Execute tasks as per the `01_AI-RUN/` script instructions, achieve AI-verifiable outcomes, and report back to their Task Orchestrator. Worker Agents also handle user validation points defined within the `01_AI-RUN/` scripts, typically by using the `ask_followup_question` tool to interact with the user for necessary approvals or feedback before proceeding.
4.  **Task-Specific Orchestrator:** Aggregates worker summaries, verifies overall phase completion against AI-verifiable goals (as defined by its `01_AI-RUN/` script), and sends a comprehensive summary to the `‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`.
5.  **`‚úçÔ∏è @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`:** Updates `:signals` in [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1). The `documentationRegistry` in [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) is updated with paths to generated documents like `idea_document.md`, `market_research.md`, or `project_prd.md` from these phases.
6.  **Cycle Repeats:** The `üé© @head-orchestrator` re-engages the `üßê @uber-orchestrator`, which uses the updated [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) and the entry-point `01_AI-RUN/` script to guide the execution of the next `01_AI-RUN/` phase.

**Subsequent Phases (Integration, Testing, Deployment, etc.):**
*   Pheromind continues to execute the workflow defined in the sequence of [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts (e.g., [`01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md`](01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md:1), [`01_AI-RUN/10_Testing.md`](01_AI-RUN/10_Testing.md:1), [`01_AI-RUN/11_Deployment.md`](01_AI-RUN/11_Deployment.md:1)).
*   Each `01_AI-RUN/` script provides the "what" and "sequence," while Pheromind agents provide the "how," always focusing on AI-verifiable outcomes.
*   The `documentationRegistry` in [`.pheromone`](.pheromone:1) is continuously updated with artifacts produced during the execution of these scripts.

This Pheromind lifecycle, driven by the [`01_AI-RUN/`](01_AI-RUN/) scripts, is designed to be robust and adaptable. **For the most detailed explanation of this lifecycle and agent interactions, please refer to the updated [`ModeREADME.md`](./ModeREADME.md:1) and updated [`logic.md`](./logic.md:1).**
