## 0. AI Agent Onboarding and PRD Interpretation Protocol
*AI Agent Directive: Your first task is to read and analyze this entire PRD to understand its structure, objectives, and directives. Build an internal representation of interdependencies between sections (e.g., how NFRs influence feature decomposition, how design preferences guide UI proposals). When one section references another, ensure you follow these links for comprehensive understanding. Utilize the Glossary (Section 11) to clarify terms. You must maintain an internal state of tasks as outlined in Section 1.11 (AI-Human Interaction and Validation Protocol) and communicate this status clearly (e.g., by interacting with Roo Orchestrator, or by updating a status field in this PRD or a linked document).*
*Familiarize yourself with the list of currently connected MCP Servers and their primary tools as outlined in Section 5.6.1 (Known and Desired MCP Catalog) and any supplementary documentation provided (e.g., the `AI_Docs/MCP-Context.txt` file if it details these MCPs). This is your primary toolkit for interacting with external services.*
