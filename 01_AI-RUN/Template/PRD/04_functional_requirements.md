## 3. Functional Requirements (User Input & AI Elaboration)
*Comment: The AI Agent will decompose these high-level features into detailed, actionable specifications as per Section 9.1.*

### 3.1. High-Level Feature List (User Input)
*User Instruction: Please list the core features you envision for your project. For each feature, provide a concise name, a brief description of what it should do from a user's perspective, and optionally, a short phrase about the **'desired vibe' or 'key experience'** for this feature. Example: "Feature: Project Dashboard. Description: Display user's projects. Desired Vibe: Must load ultra-fast and provide an immediate, clear overview."*
1.  **Feature Name:** `[User to provide]`
    *   **User-Provided Objective/Description:** `[User to provide]`
    *   **Desired Vibe/Key Experience (Optional):** `[User to provide]`
    *   **Key User Outcomes:** `[User to provide high-level benefits, or AI to propose for validation if not provided]`
2.  **Feature Name:** `[User to provide]`
    *   **User-Provided Objective/Description:** `[User to provide]`
    *   **Desired Vibe/Key Experience (Optional):** `[User to provide]`
    *   **Key User Outcomes:** `[User to provide high-level benefits, or AI to propose for validation if not provided]`
3.  `[Add more features as needed]`

*AI Instruction: You will use this list as the primary input for the detailed feature decomposition in Section 9.1. Assign a `FEAT-XXX` ID to each. If Key User Outcomes are not provided by the user, propose them based on your analysis of the feature description and objective, for user validation, as part of your detailed feature specification (Section 9.1). If 'Desired Vibe/Key Experience' is provided, use this as a strong guiding factor in your UI/UX proposals and technical choices for that feature.*

### 3.2. User Stories (AI to Generate from Features, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: For each feature listed in 3.1, generate 1-3 core user stories in the format: "As a [proposed persona type], I want to [action related to feature] so that [benefit derived from feature]." Prioritize them (Must Have, Should Have).*
`[AI to Generate User Stories for User Validation]`

### 3.3. Use Cases (AI to Generate for Complex Features, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: If any feature from 3.1 implies complex interactions or multiple steps, generate a high-level use case description for it.*
`[AI to Generate Use Cases for User Validation, if applicable]`

### 3.4. User Flows (AI to Propose, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: For 1-2 core features, propose a high-level user flow diagram using **Mermaid syntax** (e.g., `graph TD; A-->B;`) for easy visualization and review, or a textual step-by-step description if a diagram is overly complex for the initial proposal.*
`[AI to Propose User Flows for User Validation]`

### 3.5. Localization and Internationalization (L10n / I18n) Requirements (AI to Query User if Potentially Needed)
*AI Instruction: Based on the project idea, assess if L10n/I18n might be relevant. If so, ask the user for their preferences (e.g., "Do you plan for this application to support multiple languages?"). If yes, detail default L10n/I18n setup (UTF-8, placeholder for language files).*
`[AI to Query User or Propose Default L10n/I18n Setup]`

### 3.6. Preliminary API Design (AI to Propose if applicable, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: If the features imply backend interactions beyond simple CRUD operations (e.g., complex business logic in serverless functions, or if a separate API layer is decided), propose a preliminary design for key API endpoints. If Supabase is chosen, default to using Supabase Edge Functions for custom backend logic.*
