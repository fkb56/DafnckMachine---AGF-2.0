## 6. Test and Validation Plan (AI to Propose, User to Validate)

### 6.1. Test Strategy (Including AI Generation)
*AI Instruction: Propose a comprehensive test strategy. Specify types of tests you will generate (Unit, Integration, E2E skeletons), frameworks (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright), and target code coverage (e.g., 80% unit test coverage for your generated code).*

##### 6.1.1. Definition of Done (DoD) for UI Tasks (AI to Propose)
*AI Instruction: Propose a clear "Definition of Done" for tasks involving UI development. This DoD should ensure that functional code also meets the high-quality design and UX standards of the project. Refer to `design_conventions.md` (once populated) and `AI_Design_Agent_Optimization.md`.*
*AI Proposal for UI Task DoD:*
*   *Functionality implemented as per acceptance criteria (Section 6.2).*
*   *Code adheres to `coding_conventions.md`.*
*   **Visuals & Interactions:**
    *   *UI matches mockups/prototypes (if available) and strictly adheres to `design_conventions.md` (colors, typography, spacing, iconography, component styles).*
    *   *All interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled, loading) are correctly implemented and visually distinct as per `design_conventions.md`.*
    *   *Micro-interactions and animations (if applicable) are smooth, purposeful, and align with `design_conventions.md` (Section 5.2.2).*
*   **Responsiveness:** Component/page is verified and functions correctly across all target breakpoints defined in `design_conventions.md` (or Section 4.7).
*   **Accessibility (A11Y):**
    *   *Passes automated A11Y checks (e.g., Axe DevTools).*
    *   *Full keyboard navigability confirmed for all interactive elements.*
    *   *Semantic HTML is used appropriately.*
    *   *Sufficient color contrast verified.*
    *   *ARIA attributes used correctly where necessary.*
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Verified on latest two versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (as per Section 4.7).
*   **Documentation:** Component is documented in Storybook (if applicable) with props and usage examples.
*   **Testing:** Relevant unit/integration tests for UI logic are passing.

### 6.2. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin/BDD Format - AI to Generate)
*AI Instruction: For each User Story you generate (Section 3.2), you will also generate corresponding acceptance criteria in Gherkin format ("GIVEN... WHEN... THEN...") in your detailed feature specifications (Section 9.1.4). These will form the basis for automated tests.*
`[This section is a directive to the AI; criteria will be in AI's feature specs]`

### 6.3. Detailed Test Scenarios for AI Agent (AI to Generate)
*AI Instruction: In your feature specifications (Section 9.1), beyond Gherkin ACs, you will generate detailed test scenarios (nominal, error, edge cases) that you will use to implement specific test cases.*
`[This section is a directive to the AI; scenarios will be in AI's feature specs]`

### 6.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (User to Define Process)
*User Instruction: Please describe how you plan to conduct User Acceptance Testing. Who will participate? What are the key scenarios they should test? How will feedback be collected? The AI can help prepare test data or environments if instructed.*
`[User to Define UAT Process]`

### 6.5. Performance, Security, etc. Tests (Criteria for AI - AI to Propose)
*AI Instruction: Propose how critical NFRs (performance, security) will be tested, potentially involving tools like Lighthouse, k6 (for load testing stubs you might generate), or basic OWASP ZAP scans you might configure/run. Detail this in your NFR verification plan (Section 4.10) and feature specs.*
