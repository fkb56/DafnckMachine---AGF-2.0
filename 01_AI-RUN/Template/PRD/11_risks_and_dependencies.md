## 10. Risks and Dependencies (AI to Identify, User to Validate)

### 10.1. Risk Identification
*AI Instruction: Based on the project scope and chosen technologies, identify potential technical risks (e.g., complexity of a feature, integration challenges with a proposed MCP/API, performance bottlenecks with chosen database queries if not designed carefully). The AI's ability to perform deep market/competitive risk analysis is limited; focus on technical and implementation risks.*

### 10.2. Risk Mitigation Plan
*AI Instruction: For each significant risk identified, propose a mitigation strategy. This might involve alternative technical approaches, more detailed prototyping, or specific testing strategies.*
`[AI to Propose Mitigation Plans for User Validation]`

### 10.3. Dependencies
*AI Instruction: List key external dependencies (known MCP servers, proposed third-party APIs, specific features of the chosen backend (e.g., Supabase) critical to the project) and any assumptions made about their availability or functionality. Highlight where user action might be needed for setup or API keys.*
