## 11. Glossary (AI to Maintain)
*AI Instruction: Maintain a glossary of technical terms, acronyms, project-specific jargon, and names of key MCPs or services used, to ensure common understanding.*
*   **Agentic Coding System:** Our holistic methodology for developing high-quality software, emphasizing design finesse, technical excellence, and intelligent AI agent collaboration.
*   **Design System `[AI to Propose Project Name] Design System`:** The single source of truth for all UI components, design tokens, and styling guidelines for this project.
*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server:** An external tool or service, often an API, that the AI Agent can interact with to perform specialized tasks (e.g., payment processing, documentation lookup, code analysis, GitHub operations). The AI Agent uses predefined MCPs where available or can be instructed by the user on how to connect to new ones if they follow a compatible API structure or if an MCP server wrapper can be created for them. When proposing an MCP, the AI will specify its known capabilities, the primary function it will serve, and if it's a standard known MCP or one requiring user setup/connection details.
*   **Supabase (if chosen):** A Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform providing database, auth, storage, edge functions, etc. (This is a suggested default).
*   **Next.js (if chosen):** A React framework for the frontend. (This is a suggested default).
*   **Tailwind CSS:** The utility-first CSS framework for styling.
*   **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of UI components used as a customizable base, to be heavily adapted to the project's Design System.
