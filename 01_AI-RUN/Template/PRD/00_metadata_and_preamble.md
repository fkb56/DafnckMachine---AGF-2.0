# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Streamlined Agentic AI Workflow

**Project Name:** `[User to Insert Project Name Here, or AI to Propose]`
**Version:** `[AI to update e.g., 1.0, 1.1 after user validation cycle]`
**Last Updated:** `[AI to Fill: Current Date]`
**Author(s):** `[User Name/ID] (Initial Idea) & AI Coding Agent (Elaboration)`
**Key Stakeholders:** `[User Name/ID], AI Coding Agent`

**Preamble: Streamlined Workflow Approach**
This PRD template is designed for a streamlined workflow where the primary user input is the core project idea and desired high-level features. The AI Coding Agent is expected to take significant initiative in proposing technical details, design elements, and specific tooling. While a Next.js and Supabase stack is suggested as a default (and detailed in Section 1.10), this is a recommendation. The user will have the final say in choosing the most appropriate frontend, backend, and other technologies based on project needs, PRD analysis, market research, or other factors. Human validation will occur at key decision points proposed by the AI, as outlined in the AI-Human Interaction Protocol (Section 1.11).
