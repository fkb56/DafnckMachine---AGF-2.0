## 7. Deployment and Launch Plan (AI to Propose, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: Propose a basic deployment and launch plan, assuming a common hosting solution for the chosen frontend (e.g., Vercel for Next.js) and managed services for the chosen backend (e.g., Supabase).*

### 7.1. Deployment Strategy
*AI Proposal:* Phased deployment: Staging/Preview environment (Vercel Previews) for review, followed by Production deployment.
`[User to Adjust/Confirm AI's Proposed Deployment Strategy]`

### 7.2. Deployment Prerequisites
*AI Proposal:*
*   Vercel account connected to Git repository.
*   Backend project (e.g., Supabase) created and environment variables configured in the frontend hosting provider (e.g., Vercel).
*   Domain name configured (if applicable).

### 7.3. Deployment Scripts (Instructions for AI Agent)
*AI Instruction: Deployment will primarily be handled by Vercel's CI/CD. You will ensure the `package.json` build scripts are correct and any necessary Vercel configuration files (e.g., `vercel.json`) are set up if non-standard settings are needed.*
`[This section outlines AI's responsibility for Vercel deployment setup]`

### 7.4. Rollback Plan
*AI Proposal:* Vercel provides immutable deployments, allowing easy rollback to previous production deployments via the Vercel dashboard.

### 7.5. Launch Communication
*User Instruction: Outline any specific communication needed for launch (e.g., informing beta testers, internal team announcement).*
