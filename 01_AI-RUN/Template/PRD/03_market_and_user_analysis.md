## 2. Market and User Analysis (AI to Assist/Research if Instructed)

### 2.1. Market Research Summary (Optional User Input / AI Research Task)
*User Instruction: If you have market research, please summarize key findings or provide a link. Alternatively, you can instruct the AI to perform high-level online research on the market, target audience, and competitors based on your project idea.*
`[User Input or AI Research Task: e.g., "AI, please research competitors for a [Project Idea] app."]`
*AI Instruction: If tasked, perform high-level research and summarize findings here. Prioritize information from official documentation, reputable industry sources. If using general web search, cross-reference information from multiple sources where possible. Clearly state if information is from a less verifiable source. If a `context7` MCP or similar trusted documentation MCP is available, prioritize its use. Your research here is to provide initial context; deep strategic analysis remains a human responsibility. Cite sources if possible.*

### 2.3. Target Audience (AI to Propose, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: Based on the project idea and research, propose a primary target audience. Describe key demographics, needs, and behaviors.*
`[AI to Propose Target Audience for User Validation]`

### 2.4. User Personas (AI to Generate Drafts, User to Validate)
*AI Instruction: Based on the Target Audience, generate 1-2 draft user personas. Include name, core goals, key frustrations (that the product will solve), and a brief scenario of how they might use the product.*
`[AI to Generate Draft Personas for User Validation]`

        *   Goals: ...
        *   Frustrations: ...
        *   Usage Scenario: ...

### 2.5. Competitive Analysis (Optional User Input / AI Research Task)
